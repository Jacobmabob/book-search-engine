  ## Description

  This project is a fullstack application which functions as a Book Search Engine, using the GoogleBooks API. My objective was to take a fully functioning app with a RESTful backend API and convert it to GraphQL.
  The process began with incoporating the Apollo Server, creating TypeDefs for defining our GraphQL schema, and creating Resolvers as routes to access the GraphQL database.
  After the backend was fully converted, I moved on to converting the front end fetch calls to GraphQL queries/mutations.

  The app is deployed live here: https://limitless-lowlands-58198.herokuapp.com/
